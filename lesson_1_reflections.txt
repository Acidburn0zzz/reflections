How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped in identifying where exactly the bug was introduced so that it is easier to correct it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will help us make changes to the code without having to worry if those changes will cause an irrevertible damage.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing will give us more control over what we want to save. But if we forget to commit, its a problem.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This may be because files saved in version control systes like Google Docs may not be dependent on each other. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We can use git log to find the different commits done to the file, and git diff to find the changes in two different commits of a file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We will have the option of checkout to restore a previous working version of the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git to keep track of my code.
